# InSpec Profile: wannacry-exploit

This InSpec profile was created to scan a Windows machine for hotfixes known
to mitigate the WannaCry ransomware vulnerability. These are documented in
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023262/how-to-verify-that-ms17-010-is-installed

Later OS Build and Monthly Security Rollup KBs will have the fix incorporated,
newer builds may be flagged as not having the patch applied and the controls
will need to be updated accordingly.
